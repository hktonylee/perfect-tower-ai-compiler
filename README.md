This script allows you to compile the "AI code" of [The Perfect Tower II](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1197260/The_Perfect_Tower_II/) from command line.

Example usage:

```bash
perfect-tower-ai-compiler lib 'Turbo mouse click' 'My super script'
```

Although its name is "AI", it is just some Turing completed programming language with some ridiculous restrictions.

You can refer to [this page](https://d0sboots.github.io/perfect-tower/) for the syntax of the AI.
